# Flexbox Navigation Examples
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. 

## Why Flexbox
CSS layouts were historically limited to tools such as floats and positioning that were reliable and cross-browser compatible, but also limiting and frustrating in some ways. These tools are insufficient for achieving certain layout designs conveniently and flexibly. For example, it is difficult or impossible to vertically center a block of content inside its parent, make all children of a container take up an equal amount of available width/height, or make all columns in a multiple-column layout have the same height regardless of the content amount.
